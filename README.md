## Resources

- **Audio**  
  The audio system was inspired by the following repository:  
  [Assembly8086IMFPlayer](https://github.com/leonardo-ono/Assembly8086IMFPlayer/blob/main/imfplay.asm)  
  We integrated this with some fixes to make it compatible with our code.

- **Game Development**  
  The game development was based on this tutorial:  
  [8086 Assembly Game Development](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5v1Pz0bzO1g)  
  We added **more features** and resolved **compatibility issues** between assemblers **TASM** and **NASM**.
